# AI Assistance Disclaimer

This is a hobby project to solve a personal need and learn how AI tools can be used in software development.

## AI Tools Used

AI assistance was utilized for:

- **Feature Development** - 'Bells and whistles' like the stats page and parts of the settings page
- **Styling** - CSS and UI refinements
- **Code Completion** - IDE-based code completion and suggestions
- **Documentation** - README content, inline comments, and documentation
- **Configuration** - Docker setup, CI/CD workflows, and configuration files
- **Commit Messages** - Generating descriptive commit messages
- **Testing** - Test scaffolding and test case suggestions

## Human Oversight

While AI assistance was utilized throughout development:

- All code has been reviewed and understood by the developer
- All functionality has been tested manually and with automated tests
- Code has been customized and adapted for this specific application
- Security-sensitive areas have been given extra scrutiny

## Recommendation

Users should review and understand the code before deployment in production environments. This is good practice regardless of whether AI was involved in development.

## Why Disclose This?

Transparency about AI usage in software development is important. This disclosure:

1. Helps users make informed decisions about using the software
2. Contributes to honest conversations about AI in development
3. Acknowledges the collaborative nature of modern software development

## Prompt Logs

User prompts/requests made during AI-assisted development are logged in the [`.prompts/`](.prompts/) directory. These logs contain:

- The user's requests (not AI responses)
- Context notes (open files, screenshots, error messages)
- Dated log files for each development session

This provides additional transparency about how AI assistance was directed during development.
