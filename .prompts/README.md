# Prompt Logs

This directory contains logs of prompts/requests used during AI-assisted development.

## Structure

- `YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Daily log files containing user prompts
- Each entry includes:
  - Timestamp (when available)
  - The user's request/prompt
  - Context notes (open files, pasted images, etc.)

## Purpose

These logs provide transparency about AI assistance used in development and may be useful for:

- Understanding the development process
- Reproducibility of AI-assisted work
- Educational purposes

## Note

These are the user's prompts only, not AI responses. The actual implementation may differ from what was requested as code is reviewed and refined.
